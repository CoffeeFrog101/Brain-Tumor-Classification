# Brain-Tumor-Classification
This is my final year project. This project revolves around implementing a neural network that can classifiy different types of Brain tumor from MRI scans. The types of tumors where glioma , meningioma  and pituitary 

# Convolutional neural network 
The proposed method will involve pre-processing the MRI scans to extract relevant features, training a CNN using a dataset of MRI scans with and without brain tumours, and evaluating the CNN's performance on a separate test dataset. The project will also involve fine-tuning the CNN's architecture and hyperparameters to achieve optimal performance.
This project hopes to have the  potential to make a significant impact in the field of medical imaging by providing a fast and accurate method for detecting brain tumours in MRI scans. It could aid radiologists in making a more accurate diagnosis and help to improve the prognosis for patients with brain tumours. The project will also provide an opportunity to gain hands-on experience with CNNs and apply the latest research in the field of medical image analysis. The model used is VGG16. LeNet5 was used for comparison.

# Instructions
Make sure to run the BrainTumorDetection.ipynb in google collab or anything similar. Till i figure out how can i push 2.5 GB worth of A.I models :(. Run the training code block, the results will probably be the same(should be 95% VGG16 , 90-85% for LeNet5) and  make sure to change the directories. HAVE FUN!!!!!
